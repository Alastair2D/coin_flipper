Coin Flipper

Requirements:
1. I can flip a coin
2. I can see whether the coin landed head or tails
3. I can see how many times the coin lands tails

Step 1: Domain model.  Actually draw / model the classes and interactions between them. 

coin_flipper.rb has the following methods:
.flip_coin (covers US1 and US2)
.tails_count 

A user would call #flip_coin and  
A user would call #tails_count and see how many tails have occurred 

NB: User stories can mislead good development.  Think about them not as an isolated thing and think about a user journey - think about the interaction a user would have with the app, what would make logical sense?
